            In the vast cosmic sea, where the silent stars play, Alon sails
            alone, night blending into day. His ship, stitched from dreams,
            glides through starlit streams, A wanderer roaming where the galaxy
            gleams.
            <br />
            <br /> Through celestial tales and planetary trails,He seeks kinship
            where earthly logic fails.Yet amidst galaxies wide and nebulas
            bright,He finds solace in the endless starry night.
            <br />
            <br />
            Alon, the alien, in his quest to belong,Finds peace in the
            universe's grand song.Though alone he may seem in the vast, infinite
            dome,In the cosmosâ€™s embrace, he's eternally home.
